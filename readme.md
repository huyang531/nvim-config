# This is my NeoVim setup.

## Getting Started

1. Upgrade your shell following [this section](#UpgradeShell)

1. Clone this repository to `~/.config/nvim`

1. Follow the guides below to install external dependencies and make sure you are using the latest NeoVim release

1. Start using NeoVim!

### Telescope

Telescope relies on [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) for Live Grep and Find in Files capabilities.

Please also refer to their GitHub Repo for other dependencies such as `fd`.

## Known Issues

1. Telescope currently relies on the frozen verson of `nvim-treesitter` (on the `master` branch). When a new version of `telescope` is released that works on the `main` branch of `treesitter`, update `treesitter.lua` accordingly to track the `main` branch.

## Upgrade Shell
